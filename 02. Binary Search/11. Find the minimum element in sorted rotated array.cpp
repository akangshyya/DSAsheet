/*
Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. 
For example, the array nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become:
[4,5,6,7,0,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times.
[0,1,2,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.
Given the sorted rotated array nums of unique elements, return the minimum element of this array.
